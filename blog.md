# Terrain Modelling

## Introduction

I have been looking for some more simulation style projects to attempt. Recently I have been really enjoying some of the virtual environment apps. One I use all the time while working or studying is [Virtual Cottage](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1369320/Virtual_Cottage/). For some time I have been wanting to attempt a terrain simulation project and I thought a terrain simulation would work quite well for something like this.

### Resources

I have to acknowledge [Sebastian Lague](https://www.youtube.com/@SebastianLague) and the videos made on procedural terrain generation.

## Implementation

I will be using rust and [bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) for this project.

### Noise
